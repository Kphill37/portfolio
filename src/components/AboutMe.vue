    <h1>About Me: </h1>
    <p>Up and coming Full Stack Software Developer with an intimate passion for coding and technology, and with a desire
      to
      create, connect, and grow with my peers in a professional setting. My first exposure to coding began with
      introductory
      Java and C++ college courses. I've always loved the problem solving, and creativity that can be expressed with
      coding,
      and I knew I wanted to narrow my scope. Since attending Boise Codeworks, I have also picked up HTML5, CSS3,
      JavaScript,
      and C#. During my journey, I've built full stack applications utilizing tools such as: NodeJS, MongoDB, Dot NET
      Web
      APIs, JavaScript Frameworks, and even a few projects incorporating 3rd party APIs like Unsplash, iTunes, and more.

      I am excited to continue through the wide world of Software Development, and learn everything I can so that I may
      pass
      it on to my peers, and future developers. Where I can, I strive to be "the guy" people come to when there's no
      where
      else to turn. I enjoy being able to show everyone the solution, and how I came to that solution; not only to move
      the
      project forward, but to help my team grow as well.

      I also pride myself on having a strong work ethic. I'm always pondering how I can make something easier, or more
      efficient. I thrive in team environments, and encourage proper and open communication amongst my whole team;
      ensuring
      the project goes smoothly, and according to plan. Training in Agile Development / Scrum has also allowed me to
      build up
      my time management skills to complete project goals within strict time windows. Development and technology is a
      full
      time passion that I'm certain I will never be tired of!</p>
