        <div class="aboutText">Up and coming Full Stack Software Developer with an intimate passion for coding
          and
          technology, and with a desire to
          create, connect, and grow with my peers in a professional setting. My first exposure to coding began with
          introductory
          Java and C++ college courses. I've always loved the problem solving, and creativity that can be expressed
          with coding,
          and I knew I wanted to narrow my scope. Since attending Boise Codeworks, I have also picked up HTML5, CSS3,
          JavaScript,
          and C#. During my journey, I've built full stack applications utilizing tools such as: NodeJS, MongoDB, Dot
          NET Web
          APIs, JavaScript Frameworks, and even a few projects incorporating 3rd party APIs like Unsplash, iTunes, and
          more.

          I am excited to continue through the wide world of Software Development, and learn everything I can so that
          I may pass
          it on to my peers, and future developers. Where I can, I strive to be "the guy" people come to when there's
          no where
          else to turn. I enjoy being able to show everyone the solution, and how I came to that solution; not only to
          move the
          project forward, but to help my team grow as well.

          I also pride myself on having a strong work ethic. I'm always pondering how I can make something easier, or
          more
          efficient. I thrive in team environments, and encourage proper and open communication amongst my whole team;
          ensuring
          the project goes smoothly, and according to plan. Training in Agile Development / Scrum has also allowed me
          to build up
          my time management skills to complete project goals within strict time windows. Development and technology
          is a full
          time passion that I'm certain I will never be tired of!
